Contains @Bean methods - could you add some additional context?

We have two configurations, and I don't see annotation one

Can be replaced by YAML configuration - why application.properties is incorrect?

Defines dependency management for all possible dependencies - I don't get a question

POM - incorrect, DI - incorrect

Can be placed to any folder in the classpath - why application.properties, but not properties configurations?
What about yaml?

And can be used instead of application.properties
